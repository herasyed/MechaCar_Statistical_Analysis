## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

### Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?
### - vehicle_length and ground_clearance

### Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?
### - The slope of our linear model is not zero. The p-value of our linear regression analysis is 5.35e-11, which is smaller than the assumed significance level of 0.05%. 

### Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?
### - Yes. The r-squared value is 0.7149 so that means a little more than 71% of the variablilty of our dependent variable (mpg) is explained using this linear model.

## Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils
### The design specifications for the MechaCar suspension coils dictate that the variance of the suspension coils must not exceed 100 pounds per square inch. Does the current manufacturing data meet this design specification for all manufacturing lots in total and each lot individually? Why or why not?
### - The manufacturing data for the manufacturing lots in total meet this design specification. Individually only Lot 2 & 3 meet the design specifications, Lot 1 exceeds them with a variance of 170.3.
